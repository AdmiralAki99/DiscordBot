    </ol>
</p>

## Basic Idea

<p align="justify">
    The discord server has voice channels and text channels but does not have many other features which could be desired when hangoing out with friends in a voice channel. So the idea was just to add some features and learn on the way.
</p>

<p align="justify">
    The discord bot uses a simple full stack for it to function. It uses a front end that will utilize the Vue framework to display the status of the backend. The backend framework is made up of a Express API that interfaces with the various features using the endpoints.
